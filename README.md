# Giving-Mayor-Jane-Doe-her-power
Similar to the need of installing AD on the computer, just because we give Jane Doe the title of "Mayor" or "Admin" doesn't mean she has priveleges past the title; it has to be created. This shows how to make an account an Admin, in this case, it's mayor Jane Doe. Once done the user will be able  to create users and manage them.
